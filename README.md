> Instances that Valve should have probably provided in their sdk_content release in Portal 2. 

## What is betterp2instances?

**betterp2instances** is a project with the intent to create new instances for use in the creation of Portal 2 levels. The intent is to provide a mix of instances comprised of ones used by Valve but not shipped in the SDK/Authoring Tools, instances that would be useful to mappers, or bespoke sequences in levels turned into instances to allow easy reuse. The ones included here are squarely meant to be ones that have, or could have featured in Portal 2's levels. You are not required to download any custom asset content in order to utilise these.

This is intended to be a community project - Anyone can contribute instances via Pull Requests (or alternatively - sending them directly to Ossilia via DMs) as long as they follow the guidelines for contributions. You can also feel free to submit fixes to existing instances if they turn out to be broken in some way.

## How do I use betterp2instances?

You are intended to download this as a .zip via GitHub and then to merge the instances folder with the one located in Portal 2/sdk_content/maps. You can feel free to store them wherever, but these instances will not override anything in your instance folder - if anything, they will actually fix some instances that are referencing ones that don't exist by default.

## What are the rules for contribution?

When you contribute to the project, you will be added to the list of contributors in this readme. 

- Your instance cannot contain models/textures/sounds that are not available in Portal 2 by default.
- The instances must fit the default Portal 2 aesthetic unless this is not applicable. (i.e. Things like Logic box instances.)
- Instances cannot be whole levels.
- You cannot submit retexture variants of existing instances. While there are some that already exist in this regard, they have been grandfathered into the project.
- Instances that utilise HammerAddon's pseudo-entities for it's PostCompiler should be marked in some way to indicate to the user that they use them.
- Instances based on leaked Valve beta content - such as ones reverse engineered from the Portal Companion Collection's levels - while allowed for this project, are intended to be stored in their own distinct "Beta" folder. This is to ensure if a project wants to remain 100% legally clean in Valve's eyes - this folder can be skipped over.

## Can I ship betterp2instances with my mod?
Yes! While we don't require credit if you are a standard Portal 2 Workshop level, if you are a Sourcemod or aim to release an SDK for your project; feel free to ship **betterp2instance**'s VMFs in your projects - **so long as you provide credit and a link back to this repository.**
