# betterp2instances
Instances that Valve should have probably provided in their sdk_content release in Portal 2. These are all either reverse-engineered from Valve maps or are made because they were seen as being useful and/or based on unused content.

You are intended to download this as a .zip via GitHub and then to merge the instances folder with the one located in Portal 2/sdk_content/maps. These should not override anything in your instance folder.

Credit is not required - only redistribution credit is required.
