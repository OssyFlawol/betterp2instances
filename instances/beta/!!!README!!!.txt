The instances included in here come from the Portal 2 build featured in the Portal: Companion Collection for Nintendo Switch. While there should hypothetically be legally nothing wrong with this, as it is unused content in the files for a released game that Valve signed off on, projects that may wish to skirt away from utilising this content can skip this folder.

Were a hypothetical leak of the Portal 2 Map Sources to occur, we would not allow content from it anywhere in betterp2instances.

These are the only maps we will allow reverse engineering from for this folder, as they are all found in the Companion Collection:

- demo_underground
- devtest
- fizzler_test
- ghostanim_wheatley
- mp_coop_fling_train
- outro_map
- outro_map_tint2
